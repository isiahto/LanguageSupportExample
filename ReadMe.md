## i18n using data attribute

### Problem:
Support English and French in a web page with pure js only.

### Attempt:
Found a project (see below) that use data attribute to retrieve the dictionary key, and replace the words/texts from supplied translation dictionary (a json object string-string key-value pairs)

### Summary:
Ensure the text is within elements' innerText, wrap em with span or something
